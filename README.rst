Gabon (Google contacts AddressBOk in Ncurses) is a Google contacts-based
addressbook written in Python and based in ncurses.

Gabon allows you to manage your Google contacts from the command line, making
it possible to use those contacts from the command-line and from MUAs such as
Mutt, so can be used as a replacement for abook. Another great command line
client for google contacts is GooBook: https://gitlab.com/goobook/goobook
